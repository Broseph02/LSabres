# LSabres
Website for a local area business

First official website build. Please offer suggestions and help.

I code in HTML, CSS at the moment and am learning Python/Django, and hopefully will learn SQL.

The code here is my attempt to do CLEAN coding. I am not good at it and am asking for as many pointers as possible.

Thanks for the help!
